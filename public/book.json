But these two will learn that sabotage is a dish best served naked. A sexy, compulsively readable romantic comedy that dives headlong into the thrill and doubt of modern love, Dating You/Hating You by New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren is the story of what two high-powered agents will—and won’t—do to get everything they ever wanted. Despite the odds against them from an embarrassing meet-awkward at a mutual friend’s Halloween party, Carter and Evie immediately hit it off. Even the realization that they’re both high-powered agents at competing firms in Hollywood isn’t enough to squash the fire. But when their two agencies merge—causing the pair to vie for the same position—all bets are off. What could have been a beautiful, blossoming romance turns into an all-out war of sabotage. Carter and Evie are both thirtysomething professionals—so why can’t they act like it? Can Carter stop trying to please everyone and see how their mutual boss is really playing the game? Can Evie put aside her competitive nature long enough to figure out what she really wants in life? Can their actor clients just be something close to human? Whether these two Hollywood love/hatebirds get the storybook Hollywood ending, or just a dramedy of epic proportions, you get to enjoy Christina Lauren’s heartfelt, hilarious story of romance in the modern world.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781501165825"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1501165828"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":368,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.34.31.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=josh+and+hazel&hl=&cd=7&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":10.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UEBpDQAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":10990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Dating_You_Hating_You-sample-epub.acsm?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UEBpDQAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"A sexy, compulsively readable romantic comedy that dives headlong into the thrill and doubt of modern love, Dating You/Hating You by New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren is the story of what two high-powered agents will—and ..."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"DViYDwAAQBAJ","etag":"i+BN4KD+fiI","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/DViYDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Unhoneymooners","authors":["Christina Lauren"],"publisher":"Gallery Books","publishedDate":"2019-05-14","description":"THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER! Starred reviews from Kirkus Reviews * Publishers Weekly * Library Journal Named a “Must-Read” by TODAY, Us Weekly, Bustle, BuzzFeed, Goodreads, Entertainment Weekly, Publishers Weekly, Southern Living, Book Riot, Woman’s Day, The Toronto Star, and more! For two sworn enemies, anything can happen during the Hawaiian trip of a lifetime—maybe even love—in this romantic comedy from the New York Times bestselling authors of Roomies. Olive Torres is used to being the unlucky twin: from inexplicable mishaps to a recent layoff, her life seems to be almost comically jinxed. By contrast, her sister Ami is an eternal champion...she even managed to finance her entire wedding by winning a slew of contests. Unfortunately for Olive, the only thing worse than constant bad luck is having to spend the wedding day with the best man (and her nemesis), Ethan Thomas. Olive braces herself for wedding hell, determined to put on a brave face, but when the entire wedding party gets food poisoning, the only people who aren’t affected are Olive and Ethan. Suddenly there’s a free honeymoon up for grabs, and Olive will be damned if Ethan gets to enjoy paradise solo. Agreeing to a temporary truce, the pair head for Maui. After all, ten days of bliss is worth having to assume the role of loving newlyweds, right? But the weird thing is...Olive doesn’t mind playing pretend. In fact, the more she pretends to be the luckiest woman alive, the more it feels like she might be.

When I was twenty-five years old, it came to my attention that I had never had a girlfriend. At the time, I was actually under the impression that I was in a relationship, so this bit of news came as something of a shock. Why was Josh still single? To find out, he tracked down each of the girls he had tried to date since middle school and asked them straight up: What went wrong? The results of Josh's semiscientific investigation are in your hands. From a disastrous Putt-Putt date involving a backward prosthetic foot, to his introduction to CFD (Close Fast Dancing), and a misguided \"grand gesture\" at a Miss America pageant, this story is about looking for love--or at least a girlfriend--in all the wrong places. Poignant, relatable, and totally hilarious, this memoir is for anyone who has ever wondered, \"Is there something wrong with me?\" (Spoiler Alert: the answer is no.)","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780316251013"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0316251011"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":336,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Young Adult Nonfiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":13,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.6.7.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=josh+and+hazel&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":8.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":8.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-_61gAwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":8990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":8990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/We_Should_Hang_Out_Sometime-sample-epub.acsm?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=_61gAwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"From Paralympic ski racer and YouTube star, Josh Sundquist, comes an always-funny (and sometimes-awkward) memoir about teenage misadventures.
