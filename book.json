'Uplifting and brave' - Stylist 'A riveting account of loneliness, anxiety and survival' - Cosmopolitan 'A vibrantly physical book' - the Guardian 'Claire Nelson relives a life-changing four days' - The Times 'What a story; never heard a story like that before' - Chris Evans The must-read true story of 2020. In 2018, Claire Nelson made international headlines. She was in her thirties and was beginning to burn out - her hectic London life of work and social activity and striving to do more and do better in the big city was frenetic and stressful. Although she was surrounded by people all of the time, she felt increasingly lonely. When the anxiety she felt finally brought her to breaking point, Claire decided to take some time off and travelled to Joshua Tree Park in California to hike and clear her head. What happened next was something she could never have anticipated. While hiking, Claire fell 25 feet, gravely injuring herself and she lay alone in the desert - mistakenly miles off any trail, without a cell phone signal, fighting for her life. She lay in the elements for four days until she was miraculously found - her rescuers had not expected to find her alive. In THINGS I LEARNED FROM FALLING Claire tells her incredible story and what it taught her about loneliness, anxiety and transformation and how to survive it all.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781783253838"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"1783253835"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":180,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Biography & Autobiography"],"averageRating":4.5,"ratingsCount":2,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.4.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=arsenic+and+adobo&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&dq=arsenic+and+adobo&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Things_I_Learned_From_Falling.html?hl=&id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/Things_I_Learned_From_Falling-sample-epub.acsm?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=dDS2DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In THINGS I LEARNED FROM FALLING Claire tells her incredible story and what it taught her about loneliness, anxiety and transformation and how to survive it all."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"UTE4DwAAQBAJ","etag":"w3x7U0I+DoU","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/UTE4DwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"The Anomaly","authors":["Michael Rutger"],"publisher":"Grand Central Publishing","publishedDate":"2018-06-19","description":"INDIANA JONES MEETS THE X-FILES IN THIS \"TAKE NO PRISONERS' (PRESTON & CHILD) SURVIVAL THRILLER OF A ROGUE ARCHAELOGIST TRAPPED IN A GRAND CANYON CAVE THAT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY COME TO LIFE. Not all secrets are meant to be found. If Indiana Jones lived in the X-Files era, he might bear at least a passing resemblance to Nolan Moore -- a rogue archaeologist hosting a documentary series derisively dismissed by the \"real\" experts, but beloved of conspiracy theorists. Nolan sets out to retrace the steps of an explorer from 1909 who claimed to have discovered a mysterious cavern high up in the ancient rock of the Grand Canyon. And, for once, he may have actually found what he seeks. Then the trip takes a nasty turn, and the cave begins turning against them in mysterious ways. Nolan's story becomes one of survival against seemingly impossible odds. The only way out is to answer a series of intriguing questions: What is this strange cave? How has it remained hidden for so long? And what secret does it conceal that made its last visitors attempt to seal it forever?","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9781538761847"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"153876184X"}],"readingModes":{"text":true,"image":false},"pageCount":400,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":4,"ratingsCount":13,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":true,"contentVersion":"1.2.4.0.preview.2","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=arsenic+and+adobo&hl=&cd=9&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"FOR_SALE","isEbook":true,"listPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amount":7.99,"currencyCode":"USD"},"buyLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&rdid=book-UTE4DwAAQBAJ&rdot=1&source=gbs_api","offers":[{"finskyOfferType":1,"listPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"retailPrice":{"amountInMicros":7990000,"currencyCode":"USD"},"giftable":true}]},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com/books/download/The_Anomaly-sample-epub.acsm?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=UTE4DwAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"A rogue archaeologist is trapped in a Grand Canyon cave as a conspiracy theory comes to life in this &quot;take no prisoners&quot; survival thriller that puts our hero up against impossible odds (Preston &amp; Child)."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"0nsmEAAAQBAJ","etag":"JrruUXmoiVw","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/0nsmEAAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Dial A for Aunties","authors":["Jesse Q.

I laughed out loud and you will too.”—USA Today (four-star review) “A hilarious, heartfelt romp of a novel about—what else?—accidental murder and the bond of family. This book had me laughing aloud within its first five pages… Utterly clever, deeply funny, and altogether charming, this book is sure to be one of the best of the year!”—Emily Henry, New York Times bestselling author of Beach Read One of NPR's Best Books of 2021! One of PopSugar’s \"42 Books Everyone Will Be Talking About in 2021\"! What happens when you mix 1 (accidental) murder with 2 thousand wedding guests, and then toss in a possible curse on 3 generations of an immigrant Chinese-Indonesian family? You get 4 meddling Asian aunties coming to the rescue! When Meddelin Chan ends up accidentally killing her blind date, her meddlesome mother calls for her even more meddlesome aunties to help get rid of the body. Unfortunately, a dead body proves to be a lot more challenging to dispose of than one might anticipate, especially when it is inadvertently shipped in a cake cooler to the over-the-top billionaire wedding Meddy, her Ma, and aunties are working at an island resort on the California coastline. It's the biggest job yet for the family wedding business—\"Don't leave your big day to chance, leave it to the Chans!\"—and nothing, not even an unsavory corpse, will get in the way of her auntie's perfect buttercream flowers. But things go from inconvenient to downright torturous when Meddy's great college love—and biggest heartbreak—makes a surprise appearance amid the wedding chaos. Is it possible to escape murder charges, charm her ex back into her life, and pull off a stunning wedding all in one weekend?","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780593336731"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0593336739"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":322,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Fiction"],"averageRating":3.5,"ratingsCount":12,"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.2.0.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=arsenic+and+adobo&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ&dq=arsenic+and+adobo&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Dial_A_for_Aunties.html?hl=&id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"US","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"US","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=0nsmEAAAQBAJ&hl=&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book had me laughing aloud within its first five pages...
